=SXGo!=

These are the sources to the SXGo! parallax SX emulator. 
The design is documented on the following page:

===Building===
To get this to build on your system, you will need:
* Cmake as a cross platform make (I'm using 2.6) [http://www.cmake.org]
* WxWidgets for the UI (I'm using version 2.8.10) [http://www.wxwindows.org/]
* The Boost C++ Libraries for boost.python, boost.mpl and much more (1.39, but any fairly recent version should do) [http://www.boost.org]

For compilers I use:
* Visual C++ 9.0 Express edition on Windows [http://www.microsoft.com/eXPress/download/]. It's important to note that there is a problem with the 'redistributables' for this version of the compiler: the provided manifest shows a different version number than what the generated executables or dlls require. See [http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=362504 this bug report] (and I won't comment on MS's handling of this particular one)
* G++ (4.3) on Linux. This is the one that is installed by default on Ubuntu Linux 9.04
